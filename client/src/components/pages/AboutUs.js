      Here the idea is to bring a “Smart Transaction Platform” which could be
      applicable during the day-to-day life.<br></br>
      As we know the money (specially cash) is abundantly exchange among the
      people. This money are used by<br></br> different kind of people, germs
      and many skin related diseases could be spread with this method of
      transaction. <br></br>
      <br></br>
      With this app anyone could be able to pay their own bills without any
      single use of money.And also<br></br>
      it is providing the facility of checking the usage of money for gthe last
      couple of weeks.This would be very <br></br>
      much ueful in balancing the money
